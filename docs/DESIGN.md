# Design

This repository is designed for minimalism, pure speed, and minimizing the time between thought and action.

This means that when you want something to happen, it should be as few key presses as possible.

I use VIM keybindings and the terminal heavily to achieve this.

## Animations

Animations are disabled by default.

If you choose to enable them, by default you'd have a minimal set of animations that do add a little bit of eye candy, but do not distract you from your work.

## Color Scheme

I use the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme.

It's easy on the eyes, and has a lot of ports for various applications
